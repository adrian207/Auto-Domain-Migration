## 💡 When to Use This Branch

**Use On-Premises if:**
- ✅ Air-gapped environment required
- ✅ Data must stay on-site
- ✅ No cloud allowed (policy/compliance)
- ✅ Long-term cost savings important
- ✅ Already have hardware/virtualization
- ✅ Prefer capex over opex

**Use Cloud (main branch) if:**
- ✅ Fast deployment needed
- ✅ No hardware available
- ✅ Temporary project
- ✅ Prefer opex over capex
- ✅ Want managed services
- ✅ Global distribution needed
