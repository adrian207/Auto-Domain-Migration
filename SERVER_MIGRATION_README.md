# Server Migration Solution

**Branch:** `feature/server-migration`  
**Status:** 🚧 In Development  
**Focus:** Windows & Linux server migration (not users/workstations)

---

## 🎯 What's Different?

This branch is a **specialized fork** of the Auto Domain Migration solution, focused on **server infrastructure migration** rather than user/workstation migration.

### Main Branch (master)

- ✅ Workstation domain joins
- ✅ User profile migration (USMT)
- ✅ File share migration (user data)
- ✅ Group Policy migration

### This Branch (feature/server-migration)
- 🆕 Server discovery & assessment
- 🆕 Application server migration
- 🆕 Database migration (SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- 🆕 Web server migration (IIS, Apache, Nginx)
- 🆕 Container migration (VM → Kubernetes)
- 🆕 Minimal downtime strategies

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Discovery Phase
Inventory all servers with:
- OS type and version
- CPU, memory, disk
- Installed applications
- Running services
- Network dependencies
- Database connections

### Replication Phase
Continuous sync from source to target:
- Block-level replication (ASR)
- Application-consistent snapshots
- Monitor replication lag
- Alert on issues

### Testing Phase
Validate before production cutover:
- Test failover to Azure
- Verify applications work
- Performance testing
- Rollback plan verified

### Cutover Phase
Minimize downtime with orchestration:
- Stop source services
- Final sync
- Failover to Azure
- Update DNS
- Verify all services

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Data Center Decommission
**Scenario:** Moving 50 servers from aging data center to Azure  
**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks  
**Downtime:** < 2 hours per server

### 2. VMware to Azure
**Scenario:** Lift-and-shift VMware VMs to Azure  
**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks  
**Downtime:** < 30 minutes per VM

### 3. Server OS Upgrade
**Scenario:** Windows Server 2012 → 2022  
**Timeline:** Side-by-side migration  
**Downtime:** During cutover only

### 4. Database Migration
**Scenario:** SQL Server 2014 → Azure SQL Managed Instance  
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks  
**Downtime:** < 1 hour (DMS continuous sync)
