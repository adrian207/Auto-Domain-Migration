4. Recreate profile with your files (~5 min)
5. Be ready to use (~15-30 min total)

---

### Q: Will I lose any files?

**A:** **No!** Files are preserved in multiple ways:

- Local profile copied to new domain profile
- Backups taken before migration
- USMT preserves desktop, documents, settings

---

### Q: Can I use my computer during migration?

**A:** **No.** Save all work and close applications before the scheduled time. Your computer will be unavailable for 15-30 minutes.

---

### Q: What if I'm working late when migration starts?

## ‚úÖ Post-Migration

### Q: What's different after migration?

**A:** What changes:
- ‚úÖ Domain name in username (OLD-DOMAIN ‚Üí NEW-DOMAIN)
- ‚úÖ Computer domain membership
- ‚úÖ File server paths (may update)

What stays the same:
- ‚úÖ Your password
- ‚úÖ Your files
- ‚úÖ Your applications
- ‚úÖ Your email address
- ‚úÖ Your permissions

---

### Q: Why is my first login slow?

**A:** First login takes 2-3 minutes because:
- Profile is being created
- Files are being copied
- Group policies applying
- Network drives mapping
- Settings synchronizing

Subsequent logins will be normal speed.

---

### Q: My network drives are missing. What do I do?

**A:** 
1. Open File Explorer
2. Type: `\\newserver\yourfolder`
3. Right-click folder ‚Üí "Map network drive"
4. Select drive letter (H:, S:, etc.)
5. Check "Reconnect at sign-in"

If still missing after 1 hour, contact IT.

---

### Q: How long should I keep my old domain account?

**A:** Administrators typically keep the old domain running for 30-90 days after migration to ensure:
- All users migrated successfully
- No forgotten applications depend on it
- Files are accessible
- Any issues can be rolled back

---

### Q: Can I still access old file shares?

**A:** Yes, during the transition period:
- Old shares remain accessible
- Files are copied to new servers
- Both paths work temporarily
- Old shares will be decommissioned after validation period

---

## üîß Technical Questions

### Q: What tools are used for migration?

**A:**
- **ADMT:** Active Directory Migration Tool (Microsoft official)
- **USMT:** User State Migration Tool (files & settings)
- **SMS:** Storage Migration Service (file servers)
- **Ansible:** Automation orchestration
- **Terraform:** Infrastructure as Code
- **PowerShell:** Custom scripts and functions

---

### Q: Is ADMT supported by Microsoft?

**A:** Yes! ADMT is Microsoft's official migration tool. Latest version:
- **ADMT 3.2** (current)
- Supported on Windows Server 2016+
- Free to use
- Comprehensive documentation

---

### Q: What is SID History and why do we need it?

**A:** **SID History** preserves user access during migration:
- Old SID (Security Identifier) remains attached
- User can access both old and new domain resources
- Permissions don't break during transition
- Allows gradual application updates

---

### Q: How are passwords handled?

**A:** Passwords are **not** migrated directly. Instead:
- **Option 1:** Users keep existing passwords (domain trust)
- **Option 2:** Password Export Server (PES) for migration
- **Option 3:** Force password reset (less common)

Most deployments use Option 1 (trust-based).

---

### Q: What happens to group memberships?

**A:** Group memberships are preserved:
1. Groups migrated first
2. Users migrated with group memberships
3. Nested groups maintained
4. Membership validated post-migration

---

### Q: Are GPOs migrated?

**A:** GPOs are **not** automatically migrated. Instead:
1. Export GPOs from source domain
2. Review and update for new domain
3. Import and test in target domain
4. Apply to migrated OUs

This ensures only current policies are used.

---

### Q: How is Entra ID (Azure AD) involved?

**A:** Entra ID integration is optional:
- Can sync new domain to Entra ID
- Provides hybrid identity
- Enables cloud authentication
- Supports SSO to cloud apps

See `docs/08_ENTRA_SYNC_STRATEGY.md` for details.

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Q: I can't login. What should I do?

**A:** Try these steps:
1. **Verify username:** Should be NEW-DOMAIN\your.username

4. **Wait 30 minutes** (profile may be syncing)
5. **Contact IT** if still fails after 3 attempts

**Do NOT** try more than 3 times (account may lock).

---

### Q: I got an error message. What does it mean?

**A:** Common errors:

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "Trust relationship failed" | Computer can't auth to domain | Restart; if persists, call IT |
| "Account locked" | Too many failed logins | Call IT to unlock |

Take a screenshot and contact IT with the exact error.

---

### Q: My application isn't working after migration. Why?

**A:** Possible reasons:
1. **Needs re-authentication:** Login again with new domain credentials
2. **License tied to old domain:** Contact application vendor
3. **Path to network drive changed:** Update application settings
4. **Not migrated yet:** May still be connecting to old domain

Contact IT with specific application name and error.
