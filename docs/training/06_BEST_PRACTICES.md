## üîß Technical Best Practices

### 1. Infrastructure Preparation

**‚úÖ DO:**

- Establish trust before migration
- Configure monitoring early
- Set up backup before starting
- Test rollback procedures

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Deploy and migrate same day
- Skip connectivity tests
- Trust without testing

**Pre-Flight Checklist:**
```bash
# Infrastructure deployed?
terraform state list

# Trust configured?
Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Server source.local

# Monitoring working?
curl https://prometheus.yourdomain.com/-/healthy

# Backups configured?
az backup vault show -n admt-vault

# ZFS snapshots?
ssh root@fs01 "zfs list -t snapshot | tail -5"

# Rollback tested?
# (Test in Tier 1 first!)
```

---

### 2. Batch Strategy

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Start with small pilot batch (5-10 users)
- Include tech-savvy users in pilot
- Increase batch size gradually
- Group by department/location
- Migrate managers before teams
- Leave time between batches

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Migrate everyone at once
- Put VIPs in first batch
- Rush through batches
- Mix multiple departments
- Skip validation between batches

**Recommended Batch Sizes:**

| Total Users | Pilot | Wave 1 | Wave 2 | Wave 3 |
|-------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 50-100 | 5-10 | 20-30 | 30-40 | 20-30 |
| 100-500 | 10-20 | 50-100 | 150-200 | 150-200 |
| 500-1000 | 20-30 | 100-150 | 200-300 | 400-500 |
| 1000+ | 50 | 200 | 400 | 400+ |

---

### 3. Service Account Management

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use dedicated service account
- Grant minimum required permissions
- Document permissions clearly
- Rotate passwords after migration
- Store in Key Vault
- Monitor service account usage

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Use personal account
- Grant Domain Admin unnecessarily
- Share credentials
- Store in plain text
- Forget to disable when done

**Required Permissions:**
```powershell
# Source Domain
- Domain Admin (for ADMT)
- Read all user/computer/group objects
- Access to AD database

# Target Domain
- Domain Admin (for ADMT)
- Create computer objects in target OUs
- Create user objects in target OUs

- Document common errors
- Create troubleshooting guide
- Monitor error rates

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Ignore errors
- Assume they'll fix themselves
- Skip logging
- Panic at first error
- Retry indefinitely

**Error Handling Strategy:**
```python
Try:
    Migrate object
Catch:
    Log error with full details
    If (error is retryable):
        Wait 5 minutes
        Retry (max 3 times)
    Else:
        Add to manual review queue
        Alert administrator
        Continue with next object
Finally:
    Update migration status
    Send metrics to monitoring
```

  - Computer migration (offline - retry)
  - Group migration (nested groups)
  - File server migration (large files)
  - Rollback (user)
  - Rollback (computer)
  - Rollback (full batch)

# 1. User can login?
Test-UserLogin -Username "migrated.user" -Domain "target.local"

# 2. Group memberships correct?
Compare-Object (Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity user -Server source.local) \
               (Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity user -Server target.local)

# 3. SID history attached?
(Get-ADUser -Identity user -Server target.local -Properties SIDHistory).SIDHistory

# 4. File shares accessible?
Test-Path \\fs01.target.local\share

# 5. Applications working?
# (Manual test from user workstation)

# 6. Permissions correct?
Get-Acl \\fs01.target.local\share | Format-List
```

rate(admt_migration_failures_total[5m]) / 
rate(admt_migrations_total[5m])

# Domain controller health
up{job="windows-exporter", instance=~"dc.*"}

# Disk space (should not fill)
