# Server Migration Automation Build-Out Summary

## Highlights

- Replaced ADMT-centric automation with **six modular server migration roles**:
  - `server_discovery`
  - `server_prerequisites`
  - `server_replication`
  - `server_cutover`
  - `server_validation`
  - `server_rollback`
- Reauthored all playbooks to focus on host-centric migrations.
- Introduced dual-platform support (Windows & Linux) for replication tooling.
- Added Terraform inventory generation helper script.
- Updated AWX/Tower templates to align with the new phases.

## Playbooks

| Playbook | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `00_discovery.yml` | Captures server facts, services, mount points, and emits JSON artifacts. |
| `01_prerequisites.yml` | Ensures replication dependencies and credentials are in place. |
| `02_replication.yml` | Starts or refreshes replication jobs per workload. |
| `03_cutover.yml` | Executes controlled switchover with delta sync and DNS updates. |
| `04_validation.yml` | Runs configurable validation checks and publishes results. |
| `99_rollback.yml` | Reverts changes if validation fails. |
| `master_migration.yml` | Chains the full workflow and enforces wave checkpoints. |

## Inventory Model

- `source_servers` – Workloads currently in production.
- `target_servers` – Destination hosts staged for cutover.
- Host variables define replication methods, stop/start commands, database dump options, and health probes.

## Observability

- Every phase appends JSON lines to `artifacts/status.jsonl`.
- Validation produces YAML summaries consumable by dashboards or ticketing tools.

## Next Steps

1. Extend replication methods with application-specific handlers (Oracle RMAN, MongoDB, etc.).
2. Integrate with CMDB APIs for automatic relationship updates post-cutover.
3. Add performance baselines so validation can compare pre/post cutover metrics.
